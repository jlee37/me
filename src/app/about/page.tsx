        {`Each one, like you can probably tell, is a hyper-stylized little spot in the internet. They're self-expression; they're comfort. They're small pockets of community, even– visit a popular Neocity and chances are that you'll see a message board of some kind, a place where people have left all manner of warm notes for the creator of the space. 
  
        And regardless of what the Neocity looks like, whether there's flashing gifs everywhere and not a name in sight, or a fully-fledged bio and a list of all the books and songs the person's ever loved, I feel like the same sentiment runs behind every
        single site– behind every single one, someone's saying: "Hey, here I am!
        Here this is!"`}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {`In the beginning, though, it made me sad to think about how for every single Neocity, there'll come a time when it gets its last update. There's all sorts of reasons why something like that might happen, after all. The person behind it might get tired of keeping it up-to-date. Or they might pass away, or find some better way to express themselves. It doesn't even have to be that person– all it would take is for the people running the Neocities platform from the top to kick the bucket, and a million sites, a million custom cursors, a million heartfelt self-introductions would turn to 404 slush. So one wonders: is this all for
        nothing! Is this how every Neocity will be remembered, as an amusement park ditched and left behind? 
        `}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {`Well, obviously not. But I'm going to take a slight tangent before getting to why. *Flashback sounds* Ever since I was very little, I had this idea of
        myself as being not one person, but instead just one version of countless
        Jonny's. I still see myself this way; in every moment, I really am a different person, down to the atomic level– the me who spewed out this big blob of
        text is a different me than the one who an hour ago hadn't even started
        typing. The me who stubbed my toe a few days ago was a different person
        even than the one who said "ow, fuck," half a second later. It's the same for everyone. Small things add up; one day you look in the mirror and you're older than you remember. You wake up to a you who isn't so sure she wants kids, after all. And
        on and on, so that the very act of going through life is a constant kind of dying, and living, and dying again.`}
      </p>
      So I guess what I'm saying, in a very roundabout way, is that things
      "ending" isn't such an awful thing. We say bye to bits of ourselves
      everyday, and really there's nothing hopeless or pointless about it; it's
      the most natural thing in the world. Nothing is taken away from those
      Neocities still-blinking, just as nothing is taken away from the ones that
      have seemed. ! So, then, the point of nothing is taken away from any of
      the million Neocities, just as nothing will be taken away from any of
      their corpses.
      <br />
      <p>
        {`So, then, the point of this website, its intended audience, isn't really "me." Instead, it's for you! You, reading this, wherever and
        whenever you happen to be, whether you're a good friend of mine or a
        future version of me looking back and cringing; this is all for you.
        
        So, then, the point of a website like this is to capture, hopefully over the course of a long time, a few different versions of "me." It's not meant to go on forever– like all those Neocities there will come a time when jonnylee.net will come crashing down. Maybe I'll have decided to take it down myself, or maybe I'll have been killed a Western shootout of some kind, who knows. 
        
        
        
        , Different things I've seen, thoughts I've had, people I've been. But then who's this website for? is maybe a good question to ask. And the answer is that it's for you! You, reading this, wherever and
        whenever you happen to be, whether you're a good friend of mine or a
        future version of me looking back and cringing; this is all for you! It
        can't be for me, after all, because like I mentioned before the me who
        wrote this message is already long gone. You'll have lived enough life
        by the time you get here that this me, the one writing here on March 17,
        2025, will be no more than a memory of a memory. Or if you're a friend,
        it'll be a different Jonny you have in your life, a different version of
        me. Maybe for whatever reason I won't be in your life anymore at all.
        But that's the point of all this
        
        
        
        It'll be my own sort of Neocity. 
        
        So, then, what's the point of a website like this? who's this website for? That's an important question to ask.
        The answer is easy: it's for you! You, reading this, wherever and
        whenever you happen to be, whether you're a good friend of mine or a
        future version of me looking back and cringing; this is all for you! It
        can't be for me, after all, because like I mentioned before the me who
        wrote this message is already long gone. You'll have lived enough life
        by the time you get here that this me, the one writing here on March 17,
        2025, will be no more than a memory of a memory. Or if you're a friend,
        it'll be a different Jonny you have in your life, a different version of
        me. Maybe for whatever reason I won't be in your life anymore at all.
        But that's the point of all this: to preserve a few things that are
        important to me, so I don't lose them. Some things I've seen, some
        thoughts I've had, and some people I've been. It's my own sort of
        Neocity. So, to wrap this all up, a message for you, for you reading
        this, wherever and whenever you are..!`}

      <br />
      <p>Hey, here I am! Here this is!</p>
      {/* But that's not really the point in the first place. That was my
      long-winded way of saying that that's the exact reason I made this
      website. Soon I'll die. , And behind every single one is someone saying:
      "" And so clicking into a new Neocity fills me with the variety of feeling
      I get when I step into a room I haven't been inside before. Sometimes it's
      awful; there's mold creeping up the walls, or the pervading sense that no
      one else has been inside for years. Or sometimes it's too small, leaves
      you feeling trapped in. Or sometimes, rarely, if things are just right, it
      can feel like home. But whatever any of these Neocities make me feel, I
      love pretty much every single one. Because behind I think to some extent
      they're a reaction, in part, to the chaos of the modern world. Some
      Neocities even have message boards where you can drop a note for the next
      person to see. Each one is a place where the creator said: "Hey, here I
      am! Here this is!" I think it's a remarkably human thing. There's been a
      lot said already about the I think there's something to be said also about
      I guess my creating this site is my own small reaction to that. on the
      internet where you can go, a place where you can stop and take a little
      bit of a rest. they're places where in the same way that there used to be
      taverns out in the wilderness, or oases in the unexplored desert. This
      place, like all other places, will probably go away one day. I'm paying
      about 11 bucks a year for the domain, and who knows where it'll go once
      it's gone. This is a place where I'm going to keep things I don't want to
      lose– it's important to hold onto stuff like that, I think.
      <p>
        I'll share this site w/ a few good friends. If you are here, you are one
        of them. But mostly this place is for you! Aka the future me. So every
        little bit of everything in here is going to be somet
