      <h1 className="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">What is this place?</h1>I was
      inspired to create this website by Neocities, which is a web hosting
      service that hosts more than a million sweet little sites. Here are a few
      examples:
      {/* <Link></Link>
      <Link></Link>
      <Link></Link> */}
      <p>
        Each one is basically a little bit of space carved out in the internet.
        They're places to visit, to explore, even to rest. Some of them are even
        little communities unto themselves; this one's got a message board where
        visitors can leave notes for the next person to find. But regardless of
        the type of site, I feel like the same sentiment runs behind every
        single one– behind every single one is someone saying, "Hey, here I am!
        Here this is!" But the sad part is that ultimately, every single
        Neocity– every menu bar, every 'I'm ___!', every navigation link– will
        come crashing down. It's a sobering thing to suspect, and a miserable
        thing to be certain of, but it's true. Whichever nameless person's
        running the whole thing can only live for so long. And there's the
        heat-death of the universe, to boot. So one wonders: is it all for
        nothing! All that dead space, just to turn , an infinity of abandoned
        shopping malls?

        Well, obviously not. Since I was very little I've had this idea of
        myself as being not one person, but instead a collection of countless
        me's. Because in every moment I really am a different person, all the
        way down to the chemical level– the me who spewed out this big blob of
        text is a different me than the one who an hour ago hadn't even started
        typing. The me who stubbed my toe a few days ago was a different person
        even than the one who said "ow, fuck," a fraction of a second later. And
        on and on. So, the very act of going through life, I think, is a
        constant kind of dying, and living again. jonnylee.net won't stay up
        forever– maybe someday I'll decide to tear it down, or maybe I'll get
        killed in a Western shootout after a dispute over some livestock. And
        then my bank account'll run dry and I won't be able to pay the 11 bucks
        a year it's taking me to keep this URL, and some other Jonny Lee will
        come swooping in to take it, the son of a bitch. I guess I should root
        for him, though; if I'm to have a replacement, I can only hope he'll be
        cooler than I am. Hopefully he will be a sex icon of some kind.

        So, then, who's this website for? That's an important question to ask.
        The answer is easy: it's for you! You, reading this, wherever and
        whenever you happen to be, whether you're a good friend of mine or a
        future version of me looking back and cringing; this is all for you! It
        can't be for me, after all, because like I mentioned before the me who
        wrote this message is already long gone. You'll have lived enough life
        by the time you get here that this me, the one writing here on March 17,
        2025, will be no more than a memory of a memory. Or if you're a friend,
        it'll be a different Jonny you have in your life, a different version of
        me. Maybe for whatever reason I won't be in your life anymore at all.
        But that's the point of all this: to preserve a few things that are
        important to me, so I don't lose them. Some things I've seen, some
        thoughts I've had, and some people I've been. It's my own sort of
        Neocity. So, to wrap this all up, a message for you, for you reading
        this, wherever and whenever you are..!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Hey, here I am! Here this is!</p>
      {/* But that's not really the point in the first place. That was my
      long-winded way of saying that that's the exact reason I made this
      website. Soon I'll die. , And behind every single one is someone saying:
      "" And so clicking into a new Neocity fills me with the variety of feeling
      I get when I step into a room I haven't been inside before. Sometimes it's
      awful; there's mold creeping up the walls, or the pervading sense that no
      one else has been inside for years. Or sometimes it's too small, leaves
      you feeling trapped in. Or sometimes, rarely, if things are just right, it
      can feel like home. But whatever any of these Neocities make me feel, I
      love pretty much every single one. Because behind I think to some extent
      they're a reaction, in part, to the chaos of the modern world. Some
      Neocities even have message boards where you can drop a note for the next
      person to see. Each one is a place where the creator said: "Hey, here I
      am! Here this is!" I think it's a remarkably human thing. There's been a
      lot said already about the I think there's something to be said also about
      I guess my creating this site is my own small reaction to that. on the
      internet where you can go, a place where you can stop and take a little
      bit of a rest. they're places where in the same way that there used to be
      taverns out in the wilderness, or oases in the unexplored desert. This
      place, like all other places, will probably go away one day. I'm paying
      about 11 bucks a year for the domain, and who knows where it'll go once
      it's gone. This is a place where I'm going to keep things I don't want to
      lose– it's important to hold onto stuff like that, I think.
      <p>
        I'll share this site w/ a few good friends. If you are here, you are one
        of them. But mostly this place is for you! Aka the future me. So every
        little bit of everything in here is going to be somet
